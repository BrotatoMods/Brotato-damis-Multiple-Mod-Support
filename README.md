# Brotato - dami's Multiple Mod Support

Created by dami. Makes it possible to play with multiple mods. The file needs to be added by a mod creator.

### Setup

1. Add a folder called *mods* to your project.
1. Add [mod_service.gd](mod_service.gd) & [mod_data.gd](mod_data.gd) to that *mods* folder.
1. Set mod_service.gd to autoload:
    - Project > Project Settings > Autoload
    - Click the folder icon at the top to choose the file
    - Select *mod_service.gd*
    - Click the "Add" button on the right

And that's it! \o/
